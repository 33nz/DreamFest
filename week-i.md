## Gameplan

This week you'll be choosing a node module you've worked with, or are interested in working with, and diving into its source code. The lesson here is that looking under the hood is often necessary (because of bugs or lack of docs). Perhaps more importantly, it's an incredibly powerful avenue for learning.

You might like to choose a module you're fascinated by, or a module you've had a problem with. 

We would like you to give a presentation (using a projector) about what was interesting under the hood.

What did you notice or learn from its:
  - Code style
  - New syntax
  - Additional arguments you didn't realise were an option
  - Modules or tooling it uses
  - Approach to testing

What's one thing you've learnt that you are going to try including in a project?
