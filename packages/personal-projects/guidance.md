### Personal project guidance

* Prompt: what are you excited by? What's really grabbing your attention at the moment?
* This is a chance for you to stretch into something you're passionate about
* Ideally not just a static website: an 'app' using the technologies you've been exposed to so far
  * Often students want to incorporate new ones as they learn them
    * This is fine, but can be time-consuming so be wary
* Hit MVP early so you can play
* The emphasis is still learning:
  * but try to end up with something a little more polished than a Friday project!
* Part of the learning is being able to present your work
  * Tell a story, e.g.:
    * How did you come up with the idea?
    * What did you learn?
    * What problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
    * Where would you like to take it in future?
  * Slightly more polished than a Friday project presentation... have a slide deck, do a demo
* When you're 'done', you're not _done_
  * Some students follow their personal projects through and end up using them as demos to potential employers
  * Useful after graduation for more practice
    * 'modernise' your project: convert to React, remove tech debt, implement auth, HTTPS, etc
* Discuss your project idea and scope with teachers, get signed off
* Thursdays are usually project days during Phase 2
