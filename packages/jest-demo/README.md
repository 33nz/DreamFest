# Jest demo

## Setup

### 0. Installation

----

## The tests

### 1. The first test

- [ ] Run the first test using `npm test basic`

    <summary>More about the <code>basic</code> test</summary>

    The test in `basic.test.js` is a wee example for a basic Jest setup.

    Run `npm test basic` on your command line to see it at work. Have a look at the `test` script in `package.json` to see what this command is doing.
  </details>

- [ ] Try changing small things in the test

    Can you work out the difference of when to use `toBeTruthy`, `toBe` and `toEqual`? You can learn about other assertions (also called matchers) in the [Jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/using-matchers.html#content).
</details>

### 2. The second test

- [ ] Run `npm test duel` on the command line to test the code in `duel.js`

---

## Stretch

* How does the test get the functions from `duel.js`?
* Add your own function to `duel.js` and test it.
* Can you think of other things to test?
