We're going to play with a fun project called [meowtown](http://meowtown.herokuapp.com/cats) that was written by [Eugene.](https://github.com/data-doge)


Eugene is an EDA grad, taught some of the course and is some kind of blend of coder + artist + musician. He also has a very cool [website](http://fuckafucka.com) but it's down at the moment.

Unfortunately Eugene's version of meowtown is written in rails. That's oldschool so we're going to improve things and rewrite it using node.
