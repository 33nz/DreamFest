# Week 1 Tech-ins

This is a self-assessment to help you understand how you're doing with the content and main take-aways from week 1 of the bootcamp. Each of the tasks you can try will have you displaying artist, releases and listener data in various ways inside the terminal.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo to your machine if it hasn't been done already.
2. Create and checkout a branch using your name.
3. Create a `package.json` file using the `npm` command line tool.
4. Add `jest` as a `devDependency`.
5. Add a `start` script that uses `node` to run `index.js`.
6. Add a `test` script that uses `jest` to run `tasks.test.js`.

## Files and their purpose

* `data/*.js`: the data you'll use in `index.js`
* `task.js`: where you'll write the functions that complete the tasks below
* `tasks.test.js`: where you'll write the tests for the functions in `tasks.js`
* `index.js`: where you'll call the functions written in `tasks.js` so you can see the output

## Notes

* Try to write the tests first if you can.
* The functions in `tasks.js` should receive the data as parameters and return the necessary data rather than access the data directly. This will make them easier to test.
* Don't forget to stage, commit and push your changes after each task.

## Tasks to try

1. Display the names of all of the listeners
2. Display the listeners and their genres
3. Display the name of the pop artists
4. Display the release IDs of the rap and trap artists
5. Display the names of the releases by Queen
6. Display the artist names of Debra's genres
7. Display the release names of Jono's genres
8. Display the artist and release names of all of the listeners

## Clean up

1. Push your commits to GitHub.
2. If you're using a shared computer (like during a tech-in) checkout master for the next student.
