# Jest demo

## Setup

* Run `npm install` in your terminal to install Jest.

## The tests

The test in `basic.test.js` is a wee example for a basic Jest setup.

* Run `npm test basic` on your command line to see it at work. Have a look at the `test` script in `package.json` to see what this command is doing.

  Try changing small things in the test. Can you work out the difference of when to use `toBeTruthy`, `toBe` and `toEqual`? You can learn about other assertions (also called matchers) in the [Jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/using-matchers.html#content).

* Run `npm test duel` on the command line to test the code in `duel.js`.


## Further exploration

* How does the test get the functions from `duel.js`?
* Add your own function to `duel.js` and test it.
* Can you think of other things to test?
