# React Satelite Maps

This exercise tasks you with building a Satelite PoV (point of view) Viewer. You can consume an API to get the current latitude and longitude of different satelites and show a map directly below the satelite.


## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/react-satelite-maps.git
cd react-satelite-maps && npm install
```


## Next steps

* Kick off an `npm start` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to what you're starting with.
* Have a look at the Leaflet component and understand where it's used in `<App />`.
* 

## More context

* Check out the scripts in `package.json` so you'll know what command line options you have.
* Check out the commit history. You'll see this is a fork of [`boilerplate-react-webpack`](https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/boilerplate-react-webpack).
