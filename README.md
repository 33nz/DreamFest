# A starter webpack project for React, Redux, Express and Knex

This is a rad base for starting a new full-stack project, or just as reference for how to do things the Harrison way (which is with absolutely no test folder, I'll leave that one to Alan)

* Fork this repo to your github
* Rename your repo according to the app you're building
* Clone your forked repo down
* Run the following commands in your terminal

```sh
npm install
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run

```

  `npm run dev` for bundling, watch and nodemon

  `npm start` only runs server (setup for heroku)

I can add some exercises/comments to this repo if there is desire for such, but for now, hopefully this proves useful :)
