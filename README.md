rcmndr (no vowels for hipster cred) is a social media app for sharing music recommendations, either as genuine suggestions or as proof of how cool you are.

Currently in very early stages, so doesn't do what it says on the tin, but there's data flowing from the back end to the front end. Currently working on what features should be MVP and what the UX should look like.
