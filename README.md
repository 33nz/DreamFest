# Monorepo (trial)

We're trying out the strategy of keeping all the reference challenges in one repo.

To fork to a cohort run the `fork-to-cohort` script:

```sh
some-dude@computer $ npm run fork-to-cohort whai-2022 worldwide-routing

creating the worldwide-routing repo in the whai-2022 org
repo created!
pushing to repo whai-2022/worldwide-routing
fork-to-cohort succeeded!
```
