# knex-joins-stories

User stories to implement when practising joins.


_As a user, I would like to see a list of wombles so that I can know who to ask to clean up Wimbledon Commons._

_As a user, I would like to visit a `view` route for an individual womble that shows his or her characteristics so that I can identify them on sight._

_As a user, I would like to visit an `assignments` route listing which wombles have been assigned to pick up which rubbish so that I can ensure they are doing their job._

_As a user, I would like to add wombles to the wombles table as they are born (including their characteristics) so that I may track new wombles._

_As a user, I would like to delete wombles from the wombles table when one of them croaks._

_As a user, I would like to modify a womble's characteristics so that they can change costumes when they like._
