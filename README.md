# React Form Handling

Form handling in React using controlled and uncontrolled components.


## Install & run

```shell
npm install
npm start
```


## Things to look at

URL                                | Form                                                                             
-----------------------------------|-----
http://localhost:8080/             | Relatively complex form with validation and editing using controlled components. 
http://localhost:8080/simple       | Much simpler form, still using controlled components.                           
http://localhost:8080/uncontrolled | Uncontrolled component form using refs.                                         


## Things to try

Add a bunch more text fields. Try adding more form elements that control appearance: for example, a checkbox that 'features' the item in the list by highlighting it, a slider for color opacity, or radio buttons for "will explode", "won't explode", "may explode (we're not sure)", etc. If you're feeling ambitious, add a file upload component!
