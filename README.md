# External APIs - Choose your own adventure!

To get started: 

* Clone this repo

```sh
cd consuming-external-apis
npm install
npm run dev
```

Choose an API to work with, and let's get building! Some possibilities are listed below, or find one of your own!

If you're not sure where to start, we recommend:
  * First use one from lists A or B (these can be consumed from your client-side code)
  * Then use one from lists C or D, or find another API for yourself, to practice using a server-side proxy

There is a basic API route set up for you - you may wish to use this as a template.

#### Things to remember
* Create the functions that make your API calls in `client/apiClient.js`, and call those functions within your React components.
* If you choose an API that enforces CORS or requires an API key, you'll need to consume that API from your server-side, and consume your own API from the client-side (i.e. using your server as a proxy).

#### A. No CORS restrictions, no API key required, simple data structure
* https://www.boredapi.com: suggest a random activity<br>
* https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com: cat facts<br>
* https://dog.ceo/api: dog pictures<br>
* https://thecatapi.com: cat pictures<br>
